    "To solve this problem, we can model it using a Poisson distribution since the number of seedlings per square yard follows approximately a Poisson distribution with a mean of $( \\lambda = 5 )$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $( Y )$ be the number of seedlings in a 1-square-yard sampling region. Then $( Y )$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $( \\lambda = 5 )$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in finding the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} P(Y = y) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^y}{y!} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $( \\lambda = 5 )$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} P(Y = y) = \\frac{e^{-5} 5^y}{y!} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to find the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings. Since each region is independent, we can use the probability mass function for a single region to calculate this probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single region, $( y = 0 )$, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} P(Y = 0) = \\frac{e^{-5} 5^0}{0!} = e^{-5} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to find the probability that none of the ten regions will contain seedlings. Since each region is independent, the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings is the product of the individual probabilities for each region:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} P(\\text{None of the regions contain seedlings}) = (e^{-5})^{10} = e^{-50} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings is approximately $( e^{-50} )$.\n"
